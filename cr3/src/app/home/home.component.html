        <p>A bar, also known as a saloon, a tavern or tippling house, or sometimes as a pub or club, is a retail
          business establishment that serves alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, liquor, cocktails, and other
          beverages such as mineral water and soft drinks. Bars often also sell snack foods, such as crisps or peanuts,
          for consumption on their premises. Some types of bars, such as pubs, may also serve food from a restaurant
          menu. The term "bar" refers to the countertop where drinks are prepared and served, and by extension to the
          overall premises.</p>
